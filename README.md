# flutter_alexa_integration

Problem Statement: 

I have a home automation Flutter app that controls devices like bulbs and switches, each capable of toggling between on and off states. Now, I aim to integrate the Amazon Alexa app with my home automation system. Essentially, when I say commands like "Alexa, please turn on the bulb" or "Alexa, turn on the switch," Alexa should communicate with my home automation app and accordingly toggle the devices.

To achieve this, I'm seeking comprehensive guidance, including code samples. Additionally, if feasible, I'd appreciate a complete Flutter app with models and all necessary components. It's worth mentioning that I employ an MQTT broker to monitor communication with the devices.
