# flutter_alexa_integration

Problem Statement: 
I have a home automation flutter app, In which the app has devices like a bulb and a switch, both can only do on and off. 
I want to connect Amazon Alexa app to it. 
See for example If I say "Alexa, please turn on the bulb" or "Alexa, turn on the switch", Alexa should be able to access my home automation app's devices and turn on/off my bulb or switch, accourding to the command.
I want you to give me full information of how I should do it! 
Give me code samples and if possible create your own flutter app and give full code with models and everything. 
Some more context: I use MQTT broker for seeing if the communication with the device is happening or not.
